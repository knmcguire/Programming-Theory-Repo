# Programming-Theory-Repo

This game is for the final submission of the junior programming pathway of learn.unity.com. It is meant to indicate the implementation of the inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation (4 pillars of object oriented programming).

The namesaver script has been borrowed of an earlier submission of the  Data persistence project: https://github.com/knmcguire/Data-Persisitence-Project


The game itself can be played here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/build-gkl
